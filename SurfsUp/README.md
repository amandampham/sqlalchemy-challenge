# sqlalchemy-challenge ( Surfs Up, Climate Analysis)
Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
 SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration climate database. The following steps were completed. 

Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to your SQLite database.

Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.

Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.


Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis by completing the steps in the following two subsections.

Precipitation Analysis
Find the most recent date in the dataset.

Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.

Part 2: Climate App
Flask API created based on the queries from climate database. To do so, use Flask to create your routes as follows:


Start at the homepage.

List all the available routes.

/api/v1.0/precipitation

Convert the query results from your precipitation analysis (i.e. retrieve only the last 12 months of data) to a dictionary using date as the key and prcp as the value.

Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

/api/v1.0/stations

Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.
/api/v1.0/tobs

Query the dates and temperature observations of the most-active station for the previous year of data.

Return a JSON list of temperature observations for the previous year.

/api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>

Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the maximum temperature for a specified start or start-end range.

For a specified start, calculate TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for all the dates greater than or equal to the start date.

For a specified start date and end date, calculate TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for the dates from the start date to the end date, inclusive.
